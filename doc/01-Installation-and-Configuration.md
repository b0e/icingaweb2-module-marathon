Module installation
-------------------

Please extract or clone this module to your Icinga Web 2 module path. The
directory name must fit the module name, `marathon`. This would usually lead to
`/usr/share/icingaweb2/modules/marathon`.

That's it. Now you are ready to enable the Marathon module and you'll find a new
Import Source in your Icinga Director frontend. You are now ready to skip to
the [Usage](02-Usage.md) section.

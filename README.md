Marathon module for Icinga Web 2
===========================

This is a simple Marathon module for Icinga Web 2. Currently
it is nothing but an Import Source provider for [Icinga Director](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director).
It allows you to configure Director in a way that new Apps would
be deployed immediately as new service to your [Icinga](https://www.icinga.org/)
monitoring system, depending on labels, environment variables and groups.

Please read the [Installation and Configuration](doc/01-Installation-and-Configuration.md)
and [Usage](doc/02-Usage.md) sections to learn more about this module.
